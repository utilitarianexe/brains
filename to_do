rewarded stdp tests

refactoring
  clean up environment to allow for better tests without putting the test env in its own class
  also better tests for environment
  pull out parameters especially environment and display
  remove to do type comments
  document
  model files should be moved to a different directory(maybe renamed)
  we should also make a data directory
  get rid of magic numbers(most at least moved to class definitions)
  follow python style guide
  reorder parameters
  defaults on dataclasses for obvious variables, maybe freeze
  should environment be part of model or model part of environment
  simple_model output is a mess
  display and play should not run things there should be a runner that steps the displays and model

management
  pip
  fix pygame installation issue
  auto run tests on submit
  .md file for README

new funcitonality
  cells
    randomized synaptic release
    homeostatic plasticity

  display
    red should be positive green negative
    display synapse strengths
    pause button
    click on cells to see cell info
    adjust parameters without restarting
    detect screen size
    attach to unreal engine or something
    UI to build network
    cli interface
      parameters for choosing model,network,environment,display
      don't have the display modules run the model the main should

  management
    export and import models/networks
    should be a model level synapse connection strength that is then scaled per synapse
    apply the complex environment to a simple model
    add reward to the simple environment
    elf grid specs
    run neurons in compliled language

  create a one variable cell type example
    no input current variable
    cell just needs enough input spikes in short enough window to spike
    only one timestep delay betwenn precell spike and post cell spike

think about
  do we need reward for post pre stdp
  run away connections(negative and positive)
  what happens if we double spike during reward
  feel like the model is unnecarily complex
  get more backround on simulation generally(really need to retake calc)
  connecitons strengths should not just be random at the start but maybe also randomly change a bit?
  step sizes
  resettting input connections
