unsorted issues
  easy layer inhibition
  porportion award
  track progress porportionally
  sort found list
  output balance
  
  print what did fire to screen
  better way to handle running out of images
  accept fire should just record output_ids

  nmist and handwriting too much copy paste
  main file too big
  network definitions need sperated from network file
  layer based diagnostics like total input strength
  model based error condition tracking like double fires or not resetting by the time of epoch
  remove warp fudge
  paramaterize warp
  paramaterize fire rate adaptation
  print in fire rate balance
  new insturctions
  delays make sense in env
  cell_definition.x_input_position don't like the default 0
  need a world class to avoid simple_model repeating the step loop in every function
  stimuli return on env step, response return on brain step
  should not be sending simuli to all cells to filter themselves
  stop passing env to model in model.step
  abstract base class for env
  strength of stimuli is a magic number in env
  manual cell definition is ugly again
  stop with the real step check repeated everywhere
  correct cell fired is a bad name
  dumb world vs env cli thing
  default to long file x o file
  on import why does it take some time to stabalize
  dont run longer than we have images
  unit test for learning on simple network
  need a seperate epoch length/delay for envs
  get profile working again
  prints inside model should instead be an output things like average layer input strength
  network.py now has too much display info in it
  use pattern matching and type hints

refactoring
  take out dopamine cut off and warp timer parameter
  environmnet majic numbers and copy paste code(should make base class)
  hack to reset s_tag s tag stag
  main file is too long and needs tests
  switch from "model" to "brain"
  use dacite package instead of __post__init__ bs
  test parameters confusion
  simple_model is a bad name
  move parameters out of model file and networks out of network file
  clean up environment to allow for better tests without putting the test env in its own class
  also better tests for environment
  remove to do type comments
  document
  get rid of magic numbers(most at least moved to class definitions)
  follow python style guide
  reorder parameters
  simple_model output is a mess
  get example and spirit working with video, export, import, and pyplot
  arguably export should be a type of display
  I don't like how we attach cells to synapses in the simple model
  use private consistantly the _ thing
  simple_model class could be split in 3

advertising
  what else is out there
  who would want this

installation/updates
  auto run tests on submit

new funcitonality
  cells
    output balancing
    try other equation for fire rate balancing average = average * (1-alpha) + real * alpha

  display
    in pygame display labels for input and wins
    accuracy graph
    red should be positive green negative
    display synapse strengths
    pause button
    click on cells to see cell info
    adjust parameters without restarting
    detect screen size
    attach to unreal engine or something
    UI to build network
    cli interface
      parameters for choosing model,network,environment,display
      don't have the display modules run the model the main should

  management
    figure out what images we are failing on
    periodically save brains during run
    add a ./run_tests file that runs a bunch of complete runs
    add an adder environment as a mid level task
    maybe all runs should make output files?
    make a plotting tool with our basic equations in it
      like how much does s_tag decay in an epoch
    should be a model level synapse connection strength that is then scaled per synapse
    apply the complex environment to a simple model
    elf grid specs
    run neurons in compliled language

  create a one variable cell type example
    no input current variable
    cell just needs enough input spikes in short enough window to spike
    only one timestep delay betwenn precell spike and post cell spike

think about
  try handwriting with one less layer
  what distribution should we use for noise
  get more backround on simulation generally(really need to retake calc)
  connecitons strengths should not just be random at the start but maybe also randomly change a bit?
  step sizes
  resettting input connections
  multiple inhibit layers
