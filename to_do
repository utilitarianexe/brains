pull out parameters
record syanpse strengths and reload network
display synapse strengths
dispaly dopamine
pause button
click on cells to see cell info
should be a model level synapse connection strength that is then scaled per synapse

run away connections(negative and positive)
what happens if we double spike during reward

refactor
  model files should be moved to a different directory(maybe renamed)
  we should also make a data directory
  get rid of magic numbers

need a overall model parameters class for things like dopamine
apply the complex environment to a simple model
add reward to the simple environment
I feel like the model is unnecarily complex
adjust parameters without restarting
get more backround on simulation generally(really need to retake calc)
detect screen size
cli interface
elf grid specs
connecitons strengths should not just be random at the start but maybe also randomly change a bit?
record runs for later use or display
attach to unreal engine or something
better tests
UI to build network
better plugin system for other types of neurons
real documentation
pip
auto run tests and such
run neurons in compliled language
follow python style guide
go through to dos in code
