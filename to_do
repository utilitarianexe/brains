refactoring
  pull out parameters
  remove to do type comments
  document
  rename elf environment
  model files should be moved to a different directory(maybe renamed)
  we should also make a data directory
  get rid of magic numbers(most at least moved to class definitions)
  better tests
  follow python style guide

management
  pip
  fix pygame installation issue
  auto run tests on submit
  .md file for README

new funcitonality
  create a one variable cell type example
  mimic our stdp experiments in a unit test
  record syanpse strengths and reload network
  display synapse strengths
  pause button
  click on cells to see cell info
  should be a model level synapse connection strength that is then scaled per synapse
  apply the complex environment to a simple model
  add reward to the simple environment
  adjust parameters without restarting
  detect screen size
  cli interface
  elf grid specs
  record runs for later use or display
  attach to unreal engine or something
  UI to build network
  run neurons in compliled language

think about
  run away connections(negative and positive)
  what happens if we double spike during reward
  feel like the model is unnecarily complex
  get more backround on simulation generally(really need to retake calc)
  connecitons strengths should not just be random at the start but maybe also randomly change a bit?
