rewarded stdp tests

refactoring
  clean up environment to allow for better tests without putting the test env in its own class
  also better tests for environment
  pull out parameters especially environment and display
  remove to do type comments
  document
  model files should be moved to a different directory(maybe renamed)
  we should also make a data directory
  get rid of magic numbers(most at least moved to class definitions)
  tests for environment.py
  follow python style guide
  reorder parameters
  defaults on dataclasses for obvious variables, maybe freeze
  should environment be part of model or model part of environment
  simple_model output is a mess

management
  pip
  fix pygame installation issue
  auto run tests on submit
  .md file for README

new funcitonality
  export and import models/networks
  red should be positive green negative
  mimic our stdp experiments in a unit test
  display synapse strengths
  pause button
  click on cells to see cell info
  should be a model level synapse connection strength that is then scaled per synapse
  apply the complex environment to a simple model
  add reward to the simple environment
  adjust parameters without restarting
  detect screen size
  cli interface
     have parameters for choosing model,network,environment,display
     
  elf grid specs
  record runs for later use or display
  attach to unreal engine or something
  UI to build network
  run neurons in compliled language
  create a one variable cell type example
    no input current variable
    cell just needs enough input spikes in short enough window to spike
    only one timestep delay betwenn precell spike and post cell spike

think about
  do we need reward for post pre stdp
  run away connections(negative and positive)
  what happens if we double spike during reward
  feel like the model is unnecarily complex
  get more backround on simulation generally(really need to retake calc)
  connecitons strengths should not just be random at the start but maybe also randomly change a bit?
  step sizes
  resettting input connections
